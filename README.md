# National Gallery Quiz

This is a treasure hunt for the National Gallery. There are 6 paintings to find; when you find them, enter their number (NG####) into the micro:bit. The micro:bit will then give you 2 more paintings to find nearby; write down their numbers somewhere.

The intention is for people to work in teams to find the paintings. People should also take their time and spend time looking at the other paintings surrounding the art that they are looking for.

### Set-up
1. Download ['Unknown'](https://github.com/microbit-rosslowe/natgal-quiz/blob/master/Unknown) to your computer and flash to the micro:bit; this is the hex file needed
2. Download the [National Gallery Printout.pdf](https://github.com/microbit-rosslowe/natgal-quiz/blob/master/National%20Gallery%20Printout.pdf) to a phone. This has the list of paintings that you're looking for.

### What to do
Full instructions are contained in the 'Printout' PDF. You can also shake the micro:bit for additional help.

1. Look at the Printout and choose a painting to go for first; there are 6 to find in total.
2. Locate this painting and enter its code onto the micro:bit. The "code" you are looking for is on the small card next to the painting; it is the number next to the letters "NG", for example "NG345" you would enter "345". To enter a number:
   1. Power on your micro:bit. The micro:bit should have a ðŸ˜‘ face on the screen. Press Button A, and "0" will start scrolling across the screen; you will enter the number one digit at a time.
   2. Press B to add one to the digit and press A to subtract one from the digit. Press A and B at the same time once you've reached the correct digit (for example, "3"), and a âœ… will flash on the screen.
   3. Repeat for all digits in the painting's number (there are either 3 or 4 digits to each code)
   4. Once successfully entered you will see a message saying "You found: (Painting). Now find: (Painting1 Painting2)
3. Your micro:bit will tell you two paintings that are located nearby. If you've forgotten these, you can press button B on the ðŸ˜‘ screen to see the clue again. Find these paintings and make a note of their codes.
   - "Nearby" varies for each painting; some might be in the same room, some might be adjacent, or some might be a few rooms away (but all will be in the same area)
   - There is a map on the "Printout" PDF
4. Repeat for all 6 paintings! This means you will find 18 paintings in total (2 extra paintings for each of the 6)
